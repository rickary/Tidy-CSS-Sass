Tidy Sass
=========

I do like a tidy stylesheet. When I first found [@csswizardry's](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) 
[CSS-Guidelines](https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines) I loved them and tried to stick to those principles
wherever I could.

Over time though I've refined this to suit my style and this, is the result of that refinement.

***

Purpose
=======

I'm documenting how I write CSS/Sass to help standardise my work across different things I'm working on.

This will help make code easier to understand and maintain in the future.

***

Basics
======

One of the great things about Sass is that you can have a load of _partial.scss files and keep everything nice and clean. Then I use Grunt to minify the css in production.

File Structure
--------------
In my Sass folder there lives just a couple of files:
* master.scss (no styles live here, just import partials)
* ie.scss (just in case we need it for older versions of IE)
* _variables.scss (really important file containing all the Sass variables we'll be using in this project)

Then, I have three folders:
* Base
* Theme
* Tools

Base contains:
* _forms.scss (basic form styling)
* _print.scss (a print stylesheet)
* _typography.scss (type and that)

You shouldn't need to change these files, they take values from the _variables file and you can expand on them elsewhere, 'cascade' if you will.

Theme contains:
* _objects.scss (reusable objects)
* _shame.scss (temporary store for quick fixesâ€¦ temporary)
* _site.scss (site-wide styles)
* _theme.scss (page specific styles)

Tools contains:
* _reset.scss (your standard reset)
* _mixins.scss (things we @include)
* _objects.scss (turn them on/off in _variables)
* _helpers.scss (things we @extend)



Naming 'Conventions'
--------------------

I like BEM. I understand how it works in the context of my files and I think it looks quite nice too. I can't say I adhere to it strictly, I just use it where it feels appropriate.

For example:

```
.header {}

.header__contact {}

.header--mobile {}
```

So, header is the BLOCK. header__contact is an element within the header block. header--mobile is an amended version of the header, for mobile.

Spacing
-------

I like some room between sections, 5 clear lines is usually enough.

Between sub-sections and other chunks of code within a section, I'll use 3 clear lines.



Order of styles
----------------

I'll always @include and @extend at the start (top). Generally though I don't have an order for styles, recently however I've found myself doing something like this

```
.class {

  // extending and including at the top
  @include border-box();
  @extend %clearfix;

  // position
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0px;
  left: 10px;
  z-index: 99;
  float: none;
  clear: right;
  
  // size
  width: 200px;
  height: 50px;
  
  // spacing
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  
  // styling
  border: 1px solid white;
  background: red;
  color: white;
  
  // text
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  
  // everything else
}
```

Comments
========


Intro
-----

At the top of each Sass file in the project I put in the title and a brief description. 

```
// Title of the File
// =================

// For:
// Description of what the file contains
```

Contents
--------

Next comes the contents.

```
//
//	 Section-1...............brief description
//       Sub-Section.........brief description
//   Section-2...............brief description
//
```

Sections
--------

I start each new section with a large block like this.


```
//------------------------------------//
//    !Section-Title
//------------------------------------//
```

*The __!__ works to allow you to quickly search for a section. 
__!__ is particularly useful if you use Coda 2 as this places a manual bookmark in your code that shows up in the insepctor.*

Following the title block, I'll then give some more information about the code that follows.
The examples below are optional, I'll just use them as/when needed.

```
// Hat Tip:
// Attribution/link to the author etc.

// Usage:
// Explain how the code is used (more useful for Mixins)

// Notes:
// Anything else
```

Sub-Sections
------------

A sub-section has it's own type of title block. 

```
// 
// ! -Sub-Section
//
```

The space after the __!__ also shows up in Coda 2 and creates a nicely indented bookmark in the file inspector.

Inline Comments
---------------
I only ever use single line commenting - I just think it looks neater.

``
//	comment goes here
``
***

Media Queries
=============

Breakpoints are set in _variables.scss. These are generally $phase-one, $phase-two etc. for larger breakpoints and $mesophase-one etc. for smaller breakpoints.

Read more about phases & mesophases at http://benedfit.com/2013/06/atomic-design-phases-and-mesophases/

In some of my older projects there'll be a media folder containing a new partial for each breakpoint, which are @import -ed in the master.scss file.

BUT things changed and I'm reverting back to inline media queries. I just think they make things a bit clearer and using a version of [@StuRobson's](https://twitter.com/sturobson) excellent [media query mixin](http://alwaystwisted.com/post.php?s=2013-04-01-my-media-query-mixin) makes it a bit of a doddle. We'll see how it goes.
